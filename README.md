# ROP Studies
Repo aimed to Return Oriented Programming studies, buffer overflows, stack attacks and other memory corruption attacks.

- `corelan-tutorias/` is about @corelan exploiting tutorials in his website (https://www.corelan.be). Payloads are purposely broken, if you want to make it work, I recommend to follow the tutorials :)
